# My approach ->

# Part 1
I completed this task with ease. First, I discovered that the smallest perfect number is 6 and performed the differentiation. After that, I located the '.txt' file containing the code. I then proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# Part 2
I won't deny it; I've never felt so frustrated in my entire life. The challenge revolved around identifying the first element used in semiconductors. I mistakenly used silicon instead of germanium, resulting in hours of lost time. Once I rectified my error and located the correct code, I proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# Part 3
Though not particularly difficult, I found this part tricky due to my limited experience with GitHub. I had to familiarize myself with commands like 'git branch' and 'git checkout'. However, after watching a tutorial video on Git commands from FreeCodeCamp, I managed to solve it effortlessly.

# Part 4
This task was straightforward. I accessed the commits repository in the Terminal Wizard repository, where I found my clue and quickly solved the challenge. Then, I proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# End Part
The final section proved to be uncomplicated as well. I merged all the '.txt' files using the 'cat * > finalcode.txt' command. Then, I decoded the Base64 encryption and obtained the following URL: "https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell". I cloned the repository using Visual Studio Code (by the way, I used VS Code for all four parts). I ran 'TheOneThatEndsItAll.py' in VS Code, captured a screenshot of my output, and attached it to this directory.

# Git commands I learned ->

*'git status': shows modified files

*'git init': makes it as a git repository

*'git add .': adds all the files to commit

*'git commit -m "Example Message"': commits your content, a message can be added to display in the commit log

*'git push': pushes all the contents in the local branch to remote branch

*'git pull': merges all the contents in the local branch from remote branch

*'git branch': lists all the branches present

*'git checkout <branch name>': switches from one branch to another branch

*'git clone <url>': copy's all the content from the hosted URL

*'git log': shows all the commits of the current branch

*'git checkout <branch-from-where-you-want-to-copy> example.txt': Copy a file from another branch to the current branch

# Terminal commands I learned ->

*'cd <directory_path>': Change the current working directory to a specified directory

*'ls': List files and directories in the current directory

*'mkdir <directory_name>': Create a new directory

*'rmdir <directory_name>': deletes an empty directory

*'touch <file.name>': Create a new file

*'nano <file_name>': Opens the default text editor for editing or creating a file

*'cat <file_name>': Display the contents of a text file

*'mv <source_path> <destination_path>': Move or rename files and directories

*'rm <file_or_directory>': Remove files or directories

*'exit': Exit terminal session

*'cp <source_path> <destination_path>': Copy files or directories from one location to another

*'cat * > finalcode.txt': It will concatenate the content of all text files in the current directory and merge them into finalcode.txt

*'echo -n <Base64EncodedStringHere> | base64 -d': Decodes the Base64 code
