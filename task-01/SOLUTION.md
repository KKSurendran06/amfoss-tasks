# My approach ->

# Part 1
I completed this task with ease. First, I discovered that the smallest perfect number is 6 and performed the differentiation. After that, I located the '.txt' file containing the code. I then proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# Part 2
I won't deny it; I've never felt so frustrated in my entire life. The challenge revolved around identifying the first element used in semiconductors. I mistakenly used silicon instead of germanium, resulting in hours of lost time. Once I rectified my error and located the correct code, I proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# Part 3
Though not particularly difficult, I found this part tricky due to my limited experience with GitHub. I had to familiarize myself with commands like `git branch` and `git checkout`. However, after watching a tutorial video on Git commands from FreeCodeCamp, I managed to solve it effortlessly.

# Part 4
This task was straightforward. I accessed the commits repository in the Terminal Wizard repository, where I found my clue and quickly solved the challenge. Then, I proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# End Part
The final section proved to be uncomplicated as well. I merged all the '.txt' files using the `cat * > finalcode.txt` command. Then, I decoded the Base64 encryption and obtained the following URL: "https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell". I cloned the repository using Visual Studio Code (by the way, I used VS Code for all four parts). I ran 'TheOneThatEndsItAll.py' in VS Code, captured a screenshot of my output, and attached it to this directory.



# Git commands I learned ->

*`git status`: shows modified files

*`git init`: makes it as a git repository

*`git add .` : adds all the files to commit

*`git commit -m "Example Message"`: commits your content, a message can be added to display in the commit log

*`git push`: pushes all the contents in the local branch to remote branch

*`git pull`: merges all the contents in the local branch from remote branch

*`git branch`: lists all the branches present

*`git checkout <branch name>`: switches from one branch to another branch

*`git clone <url>`: copy's all the content from the hosted URL

*`git log`: shows all the commits of the current branch

*`git checkout <branch-from-where-you-want-to-copy> example.txt`: Copy a file from another branch to the current branch

# Terminal commands I learned ->

*`cd <directory_path>`: Change the current working directory to a specified directory

*`ls`: List files and directories in the current directory

*`mkdir <directory_name>`: Create a new directory

*`rmdir <directory_name>`: deletes an empty directory

*`touch <file.name>`: Create a new file

*`nano <file_name>`: Opens the default text editor for editing or creating a file

*`cat <file_name>`: Display the contents of a text file

*`mv <source_path> <destination_path>`: Move or rename files and directories

*`rm <file_or_directory>`: Remove files or directories

*`exit`: Exit terminal session

*`cp <source_path> <destination_path>`: Copy files or directories from one location to another

*`cat * > finalcode.txt`: It will concatenate the content of all text files in the current directory and merge them into finalcode.txt

*`echo -n <Base64EncodedStringHere> | base64 -d`: Decodes the Base64 code
