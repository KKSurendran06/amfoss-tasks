# Part 1
I completed this task with ease. First, I discovered that the smallest perfect number is 6 and performed the differentiation. After that, I located the '.txt' file containing the code. I then proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# Part 2
I won't deny it; I've never felt so frustrated in my entire life. The challenge revolved around identifying the first element used in semiconductors. I mistakenly used silicon instead of germanium, resulting in hours of lost time. Once I rectified my error and located the correct code, I proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# Part 3
Though not particularly difficult, I found this part tricky due to my limited experience with GitHub. I had to familiarize myself with commands like 'git branch' and 'git checkout'. However, after watching a tutorial video on Git commands from FreeCodeCamp, I managed to solve it effortlessly.

# Part 4
This task was straightforward. I accessed the commits repository in the Terminal Wizard repository, where I found my clue and quickly solved the challenge. Then, I proceeded to the spells file, executed it, and successfully found the flag.

# End Part
The final section proved to be uncomplicated as well. I merged all the '.txt' files using the 'cat * > finalcode.txt' command. Then, I decoded the Base64 encryption and obtained the following URL: "https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell". I cloned the repository using Visual Studio Code (by the way, I used VS Code for all four parts). I ran 'TheOneThatEndsItAll.py' in VS Code, captured a screenshot of my output, and attached it to this directory.
