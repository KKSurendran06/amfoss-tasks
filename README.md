## About ME
Hey, I am KK Surendran. I'm not much of a sports person; I love going to the gym. I also have a fondness for jazz music and classical piano music, but I'm not a fan of modern-day pop songs. Problem-solving is one of the main reasons behind my passion for coding.

## WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE YOU?
You should choose me because I am dedicated and passionate about coding and problem-solving. I am committed to personal growth and constantly enhancing my skills. I believe in pushing my boundaries to become the best version of myself.

## WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS? HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THEM?
In the next 6 months, my primary goal is to further develop my coding skills and deepen my understanding of various technologies. I plan to achieve this by taking on challenging projects, participating in coding contests, and continuously learning through online resources and courses.

## HOW WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will contribute to the club by striving to excel as a coder and constantly improving my abilities. I aim to share my knowledge with fellow members, assist those who may need help, and actively participate in club activities. My dedication and growth-oriented mindset will positively influence the club's environment.

## WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEEDBACK ON THE PRAVESHAN SELECTION PROCESS?
The Praveshan selection process was both fun and exciting for me. Admittedly, I faced significant challenges as the tasks pushed me out of my comfort zone. However, my mentor, Kshitij Thareja, played a crucial role as a guiding light throughout this journey. His unwavering support and guidance helped me navigate the difficulties. I'm also grateful to Abhinav Pandey for his contributions to the process. While it was frustrating at times, the experience was ultimately rewarding and helped me grow as an individual.
